description: Prepare context for continuation in a new conversation.
---

Execute the command `prepare_for_new_conversation` before closing a conversation to save the current work context. This tool generates a comprehensive summary of the current work, findings, and progress, storing it in a memory file. Use this to avoid losing context due to token limits when continuing work in a new conversation.
